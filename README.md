## Pebble

This is a landing page I built to learn more about web development technologies.

### Technologies used

I built this page with gatsby and react. For styling I used SASS. I also added some animations using react-scroll, react-waypoint, and react-spring. Finally, I used multiple graphql queries to get images for the background pebbles and also the emojis so the emojis would look the same on all devices as opposed to using unicode whose representation depends on the software of the user.

For the design I used sketch.
